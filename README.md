# Used-Car-Marketplace-with-Price-Prediction
# Notebook and Code in Master Branch


Utilized the Scikit-learn library to implement a linear regression model, achieving 85% prediction
accuracy for car prices based on key features from the dataset.
Developed a full-stack application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
to create a seamless, user-friendly interface for the car marketplace.
Integrated the machine learning model with the full-stack application, allowing real-time price
predictions within the platform.
